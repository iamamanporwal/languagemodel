## Problem Statement

1. Our app needs a Language model that can understand and summarize a person's personality based on some personality based questions about them.
2. We also want this model to help us in recommendation system.

## My approach for this solution

To solve these challenges, we can use OpenAI's API or other Open-source large language model. Here's why it's a good idea:

1. Building our own tool from scratch would take a lot of time and resources. Plus, the output could end up repetitive and robotic

2. We can teach this API to work just the way we want it to for our app. Plus, it's easy to use with JavaScript, which is a common programming language.
