Problem statement: 1. The app requires a language model which summarizes a person's personality based on few different paragraphs about the person. 
                   2. The Language model should also help in recommendation system. 

Open ai api Solution: The approach I wanted to suggest is to generate a 2 line summary of all those personality test using Openai's api or other opensource large language model api's reason being, 
                      1. It would require alot of time and resources to create our own language model and still the output would be very repetitive and robotic.
                      2. We can also train the api for our use case and It's also avaliable in Javascript.
